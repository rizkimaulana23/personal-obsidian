## Installing
We could install the Elasticsearch on local using Dockerfile.
1. Create Docker Network
	```
	docker network create elastic
	```
2. Pull the Docker image
	```
	docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-wolfi:9.0.0
	```
3. Run the container
	```
	docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 `
	-e "discovery.type=single-node" `
	-e "xpack.security.enabled=true" `
	-e "ELASTIC_PASSWORD=your_strong_password" `
	-m 4GB `
	docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.12.2
	```

If it asks for username and password, it is:
username: elastic
password: whatever that you set previously in ELASTIC_PASSWORD
