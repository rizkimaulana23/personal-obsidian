```
### Return Specific Documents
Query is for setting what specific values that you want to find.

Projection is for setting to what key do you want to show. The `_id` is shown regardless. You have to set `false` to it if you don't want to see it. 
```
db.students.find({query}, {projection})

schools> db.students.find({name: "Gary"})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('6856ae2e4c435d48af748a61'),
    name: 'Gary',
    age: 17,
    gpa: 1
  }
]

schools> db.students.find({name: "Patrick"}, {name: true, gpa: true})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('6856ae2e4c435d48af748a5f'),
    name: 'Patrick',
    gpa: 1.5
  }
]
```
