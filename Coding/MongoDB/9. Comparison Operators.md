Comparison operators return data based on value comparisons.
### Not Equal Comparison
To compare the value that is not the value written.
```
db.students.find({name: {$ne:"Gary"}})
```
This code will find students that the name is not Gary.
### Less Than, Less Than Equal
```
// Less Than
db.students.find({age: {$lt: 27}})

// Less Than Equal
db.students.find({age: {$lte: 17}})
```
### Greated Than, Greater Than Equal
```
// Greater than
db.students.find({age: {$gt: 27}})

// Greater than equals
db.students.find({age: {$gte: 27}})
```

We could use `gt` and `lt` to create a between.
```
db.students.find({age: {$lte: 30, $gte: 20}})
```
This will shows documents that have `age` : 20 <= age <= 30

### In Operator
Return all record that have the matching value.
```
db.students.find({name: {$in:["Gary", "Sandy"]}})
```
