## Six Main Points about GO
1. Statically Typed Language
   Have declare the type explicitly or it has to be inferred.
2. Strongly Typed Language
   The operations that could be done is based on its type.
3. GO is compiled
4. Fast Compile Time
5. Built In Concurrency
   Parallelism. Using Goroutines.
6. Simplicity
## Modules 
Collection of packages. If we are creating a new project, we are in fact creating a new modules. 
```go
go mod init learning
```
## Packages
Collection of different files.
## Building and Running
```
go build main.go
```
This code will build and make a `.exe` files that we can run. We can run it by using the command `./main`.

```
go run main.go
```
This code will instantly build and run the code. But this code doesn't produce the .exe files.
