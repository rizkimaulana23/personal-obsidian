When first being made in coding environment, it was made in a .java file. 

If we want to run it, we compile it and the result will be in a .class file. We could compile it via terminal by running
```
javac MyProgram.java
```

This `.class` file is platform independent, meaning this could be run in any platform. This is because of the Java Virtual Machine that will convert those `.class` file into binary code that the platform will understand.

To run a compiled java class, we could do it by:

```
java MyProgram
```
