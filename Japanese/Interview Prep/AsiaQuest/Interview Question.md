######  **What experiences have you had in which you have demonstrated teamwork?**
 One of the best examples that I could give in terms of teamwork capability is when I became the lead developer when doing group project for a company. The team consists of 5 people and working together to make an information system for social media talent agency company. 

The task of a lead developer is to setup the coding environment, for example the codebases, the structure of git branches, and what framework to use. Second, I also communicate to other developer about what their problems and try to bridge and help them to solve the problem.

That experience really taught me what it means to be in a team. Having a common goal, supporting each other until the goal is reached.

###### **Please, tell us about episodes of activities in which you worked particularly hard during your time at university.**
One time, to really know what I'm capable of, I decided to really push myself and pick everything that I could pick. This happened at 6th semester of University which is about 6 months ago.

At that semester, I'm doing an intern, I have an external project for a client, I'm having a Japanese class, and I became teaching assistant. To survive, I take notes of everything that I have to do and I have time for each type of task that I'm doing. I have schedules that I could follow. For example, from 7 am to 9 am, I do the external project. From 9 am to 5 pm, I'm doing my intern, and for 6 pm to 9 pm, I'm learning Japanese. Those schedules and tasks journal really help to do my task and keep me in track with everything that I have to do.

##### **What are your strengths and how do you make use of them?**
I would say that I'm really good at adaptation. In my university life, I have took a lot of forms of activity. I have done internships, competition, organization, volunteering, bootcamps, and all of it, I could say I became the best versions of myself and I could work there amazingly.

That ability of mine, really helps me when learning something new. I could be in a new field and within a week, I could understands most of the workflow and I could improve upon that.

##### **How did you become interested in Japan?**
Ever since I was a kid, the culture of Japan has already became daily routine. I watch Naruto after I go back from school, I eat ramen, gyudon, and takoyaki weekly, I listen to J-Rock because of my father also listen it, and so on. This went on to my teenage years where I was at that time, every media that I consume is Japanese. That goes like that until I am in college.

In college, I notice that as a University of Indonesia student I have a lot of opportunity in Japan. My country has a good relation with Japan, my university has worked a lot previously with Japan unversity, I have access to Fast Offer organization, and my faculty is fit their description, so I start to deepen my interest for Japan and started studying it.

For a full-time employee, no. But for an intern, yes I have applied to many companies. But not necessarily for Japanese companies. I mostly applied to a start-up company because I want to challenged and moving in a fast paced environment.
