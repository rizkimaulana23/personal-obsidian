Static is just serving the HTML, decorating the looks using CSS, and adding interactivity using Javascript. It is just giving the file that is stored in the Server as it is. It doesn't receive the user input as user interaction.

Meanwhile the Dynamic method, the server generate the web content in response of a user request. This is usually using the MVT architecture. The content itself is assembled by the server for each request. After assembling it, it gives the html to the user.

The SPA (Single Page Application) means the user will just receive a single HTML file for the layout  or shell and then it will be dynamically updated the page's content as user interacts with it.
