Deferred: If the developer feels that the defect is not of very important priority and it can get fixed in the next releases or so in such a case, status of the defect can be changed as ‘Deferred’ after agreement with all stakeholders.

Blocked: If the developer not able to fix an issue due to any reason say for example, VPN issue or QA not able to test due to any reason say another bug found while validating defect and impact on current defect, then status can be changed to ‘Blocked’.

A bug can be rejected by developer giving some reasoning and qa can reopen by giving further reasoning.
- For example, dev can reject when bug not reproducible at their side / requirement was not given to them.
- QA will try to reproduce and share logs/screenshot/steps etc. again or show to dev over call. 
- For documentation, it can be clarified with product whether requirement was given.
- In some cases say e.g requirement miss / design issue, it can be discussed with all stakeholders and based on agreement, bug can be changed to improvement task.
