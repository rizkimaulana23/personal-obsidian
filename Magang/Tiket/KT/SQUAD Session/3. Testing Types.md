## Functional Testing
### Smoke Test
Preliminary, high-level testing process to verify the stability and basic high-level functionality after code changes. Done at the start of testing cycle.
### Functional Test
All functional testing is being run after the smoke test is done. If bugs are found, we tell the developer to fix it before going the next round.
### Retesting
After the of the reported bugs are fixed, we verify the bug.
### Regression
After finishing the retesting, we run the testing again to check if the bug fixes (changes) doesn't cause any side effects.
### Sanity
Done at the end of testing cycle. The scope of this test is narrower because it only focuses on the part of system that has changes. 
### User Acceptance Testing
Done by the Product team before release.
## Non-Functional Testing
### Performance
### Load Testing
### Exploratory

## Based on Execution 
### Manual
Done manually from start to finish.
### Automated
Done by automation. Highly repetitive and time consuming tasks are good candidates for automation.
### Hybrid
Combination of manual and automated. Not all tests can be automated.
## Based on Test Data
### Positive
Inputting the right input and see whether the system will response accordingly.
### Negative
Inputting the false input and see whether the system will handle the error or not.
