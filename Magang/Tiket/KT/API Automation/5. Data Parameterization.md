## Variety of Test Data
Variety of Test Data allows you to test your API with a wide range of test data, including different input values, data formats, and edge cases. This is important because APIs often interact with various data sources, and they need to handle different data gracefully.
## Data-Driven Testing
Data parameterization enables data-driven testing, where you maintain test data separately from your test scripts. This separation makes it easier to modify and expand test data without changing the test scripts themselves.
## Reusability
By parameterizing data, you can reuse test scripts with different data sets, reducing the need to create separate test scripts for each test case. This saves time and effort in test script development and maintenance.
## Efficiency
Using data parameterization, you can efficiently test a multitude of scenarios without manual intervention. This is particularly beneficial for regression testing, where you want to ensure that change to the API haven't introduced new issues.
