## 1. Received the Test Case from QA Manual
In our capacity as the automation team, it is imperative that we acquire the test cases to be automated from the QA manual. Presently, our established guidelines stipulate that each end-point or API should have a minimum of 10 test cases for automation, including both positive and negative test cases. The responsibility for overseeing this management task predominantly falls under the purview of the API team lead.
## 2. Pick task / stories from TO-DO
The Automation Lead will delegate tasks to team members according to their priority. Furthermore, these assignments will be deliberated in detail during the sprint planning meeting, involving all team members. Each team member holds the responsibility of fine-tuning the task's story points, establishing the start and end dates for each story, and creating a comprehensive breakdown of API functionalities within the story description.
## 3. QA Sign-Off / In Product 
As the owner responsible for story acquisition, it is imperative that we incorporate a QA Sign-Off sub-task within each story. This sub-task is essential for obtaining approval from the QA Person-in-Charge (PIC). In cases where the provided test cases are fewer than the prescribed minimum of 10, it is our duty to engage with the QA PIC or QA Lead to ascertain if the current test case count is satisfactory. Furthermore, prior to seeking approval from the QA PIC, it is essential to elucidate the functionality of the API, including its workflow and the specific validation criteria required for automation.
## 4. In Progress the API Automation
Once we have obtained the QA Sign-Off approval and clarified all the necessary requirements, we can proceed with the development and coding of the API Automation. This entails the creation of essential test data, as well as the incorporation of relevant properties and data into the test data. Additionally, it is imperative to ensure that manual API testing has been conducted using tools such as Postman to validate the functionality.

## 5. Code Review
After completing the API automation coding and verifying its functionality on the local environment, the next step is to initiate a Pull Request in our GitHub repository. It is essential to ensure that the automation has been rigorously tested and is functioning as expected. Additionally, when raising the Pull Request, please remember to include the JIRA Link, Test Data Link, Test Case Link, and screenshots of the Extent Report illustrating the successful execution of the API automation in the PR Description. 

It is mandatory to have a minimum of two reviewers for each Pull Request (PR). The first reviewer will be selected from the team members, and the second reviewer will be designated by the lead or manager. It is still your own responsibility to diligently follow up with the assigned reviewers until the PR is successfully merged.

Until the demo is conducted and the QA Lead's approval is obtained, it is essential to ensure that the 'shouldRun' attribute in the test data is marked as 'n' for those APIs. This ensures that these APIs will not run on a daily basis during this period.

## 6. In Product UAT
After the code is merge, the next step is to conduct a demonstration to the QA Lead. This typically involves organizing a demo meeting with both the QA Lead and QA team members, during which we will showcase the API automation using the Extent Report. During the demo, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of the automation's workflow and the aspects it has validated.

If any recommendations for improvements are put forth by the QA Lead during the demo session, it is your responsibility to create an Improvement Jira Task, assigned it to yourself and prioritize it based on your current workload and availability.

Upon the completion of the demo session, you should make the QA Demo sub-task for all the stories that have been presented. Subsequently, you must seek approval and sign-off from the QA Lead.

In cases where improvements are identified during the demo, it is imperative to create Jira Improvement tasks that are linked to the main Jira story to ensure a seamless and organized workflow.

Additionally, it is important to update the API details in the API Automation Master Summary on the SDET Google Sheets (LINK). To track and complete this task, you need to make a sub-task labeled 'Update API Master Summary' within the respective Jira story. This sub-task must be marked as 'DONE' once the API Automation Master Summary on the SDET Google Sheets has been updated.
## 7. DONE
Once the API automation is complete and has undergone successful demoing, it is crucial to ensure that the 'shouldRun' flags in test data are marked as 'y', signifying that these APIs are now set to run regularly.

Moreover, you bear the responsibility of maintaining these APIs. This includes monitoring for any automation failures, conducting analysis to identify issues, and performing necessary fixes or maintenance as required to ensure their continued reliability and performance.
## 8. Defect
In the event of automation failures, the individual responsible for creating the API automation is tasked with taking action. It is imperative to conduct a thorough analysis to pinpoint the root cause of the failure, distinguishing whether it stems from the API itself or the automation code.
If the cause is determined to be related to the API, and the failure occurs on a staging environment, the next step is to raise a defect report. This report should be provided to the QA team for further evaluation to determine the validity of the defect and whether it necessitates additional action.
