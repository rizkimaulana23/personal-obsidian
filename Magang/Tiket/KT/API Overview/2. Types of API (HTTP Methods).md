## GET Method
Definition: The GET method is one of the most straightforward API interactions. It's used to retrieve data from a server.

Use Cases: GET requests are typically used for read-only operations. For example, when you open a webpage in your browser, your browser is making a GET request to retrieve the page's content from a server. GET requests should not modify any data on the server; they are meant for retrieval only

- Without request body
- Using params or header to input the data if needed
## POST Method
Definition: POST requests are used to create new data on the server. They submit data to be processed to a specified resource.

Use Cases: When you fill out a sign up form for a new user account, the data you enter is sent to the server via a POST request. The server processes this data and creates a new user account based on your input.

- Usually using request body to input data required, but some of the APIs also possible to be used without request body
- Using params or header to input the data if needed
## DELETE Method
Definition: The DELETE method, as the name suggests, is used to remove data from the server.

Use Cases: When you want to delete a resource, you send a DELETE request. For example, if you no longer need a particular file stored on a server, a DELETE request will be used when you delete that file.

- Without request body
- Using params or header to input the data if needed

## PUT Method
Definition: The PUT method is used to replace or overwrite the entire data or representation of a resource on the server with new data. When you send a PUT request, you're essentially replacing the entire resource with the new representation you include in the request.

Use Cases: When you want to edit an existing resource, you send a PUT request with the updated data. For the example, if you're want to change your phone number in your account, you would use a PUT request to update that specific contact's information.
## PATCH Method
Definition: The PATCH method is used to make partial or incremental changes to the data on a resource on the server. When you send a PATCH request, you only need to send the parts of the data that need to be updated; you don't have to send the entire representation.

Use Cases: When you have a resource representing contact information and you only want to change the contact's phone number, you can use the PATCH method to send only the part of the data that includes the updated phone number, without sending all the other contact information.
