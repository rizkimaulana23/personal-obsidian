## Data Validation
Ensuring that the data sent to an API is correct, complete, and in the expected format. 

In API automation, you need to validate the request payloads or the data sent to the API and the response payloads (data received from the API). This includes for the right data types, required fields, and valid values.

## Authentication or Authorization
Authentication verified the identity of a user or system, while authorization determines what actions they're allowed to perform.

In API automation, you must validate that authentication mechanisms are functioning correctly, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain API endpoints or perform specific operations. This helps maintain security and data integrity.
## Error Handling
Involves how an API responds when something goes wrong, such as returning informative error messages.

In API automation, it's crucial to test how the API handles errors. This includes verifying that the API provides meaningful error responses with appropriate status codes and error messages, making it easier for us to diagnose and ask the developers to fix issues.

## Response Times Validation
Process of evaluating and verifying the time it takes for an API to respond to a request. It measures the API's performance by assessing how quickly it can process a request and provide a response.
