In the code, there are Author, Vertical, Tribe, Module, Test, and DataProvider. What does that mean?

There are two codebases, TIKET-AUTOMATION and TIKET-API-AUTOMATION. What is the difference and which one am I going to work on?

TTD, have a lot of tasks. 

Jira, Github, Testrail, Google Sheets, Jenkins.

GK = Staging.
GK is handed to devs. We won't be doing in the GK. We will only be doing into the PreProd.

Jenkins. Click on the TTD Dashboard automation. testname = title. Jenkins is to run the test. We need to add the test to the Jenkins.

The Structure of the Google Sheets is the same. We could make the sheets.

After the merged, we need to Demo itu with the lead. Then after we confirmed it, the lead will comment of the Demo. Then it will be done.

To test the local, do not changes the sheets. Just make the copy to run it on the local.

### Github Branching
I will create a new branch. Just push the branch. Need to check the file changes. 

Need to attach the Jira link and the Test data, Jenkins Report. First review from copilot. Copilot access? Raised PR?
