So, there are directorate, division, department, and team.

One thing that I just learned is the on time culture here is not really strong. For example. mas Arbi and the others come to the office past 11 am. So I think I could slack a little. 

And the seat assignment is not that strict. That kinda sucks because I can't really get to know other people. Maybe I will know other people when I received a real task to do.

What does velocity mean? What does this sheets mean?
